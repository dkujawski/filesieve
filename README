this started as a little tool for me to get rid of duplicate media files in a collection of merged media libraries.
i needed a way to identify duplicate files that had different names and move them into a separate location.

## development workflow with uv

create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

sync project dependencies from `pyproject.toml`:

```bash
uv sync
```

run the CLI entry point:

```bash
uv run filesieve --help
```

build source and wheel distributions:

```bash
uv build
```

## running tests

run the test suite with:

```bash
uv run pytest
```
